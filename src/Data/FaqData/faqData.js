    "answer": "We recommend that you eat well before you come in, and remember to stay hydrated. If you start to feel woozy, have a soda. Sugar is your friend in this situation. It’s best not to party the night before !THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! because alcohol can increase bleeding for up to 24 hours. Blood also dilutes our pigments, affecting both the appearance of your tattoo as well as the healing process. Remember to stay calm and cool, you’re in good hands. There’s nothing to stress over—it’s just a tattoo! On the day of the session, wear loose clothing that will not rub the tattooed area. Also keep in mind that for some tattoos you will have to undress more. Choose the right clothes for your own comfort. Maintain your hygiene! That means taking a shower and wearing deodorant. Getting a tattoo means being up close and personal with our artists, so make sure you are smelling great and feeling clean."

You will need such materials as antiseptic / neutral soap or intimate hygiene washing liquid, paper towels and a special tattoo cream (this you can buy in our studio)"

  {
    "question": "+ I have an allergic reaction, what now?",
    "answer": "It is possible to have allergic reactions to certain types of inks. This is more common in red tones and some blues due to the pigments used, but can also happen on a lesser scale with other colours. There is no way for our artists to predict reactions of individual clients to these pigments. There is also a possibility of having a reaction to Hypafix/Tatu-derm bandages due to the adhesive. Though it is a medical grade product there is still the slight chance it could irritate the skin. In the event that this occurs, remove the bandage and do not reapply. Though we appreciate being informed of any reactions or complications any clients may have during their healing process it is very important to contact a licensed medical professional if any symptoms seem concerning."
