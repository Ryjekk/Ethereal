    "question": "+ How do I prepare for my upcoming appointment?",
    "answer": "So you’re getting your tattoo soon, it's time to prepare! Maintain your hygiene! That means taking a shower and wearing deodorant. Getting a tattoo means being up close and personal with our artists, so make sure you are smelling great and feeling clean. Dress appropriately. Make sure to wear loose clothing that can easily reveal the area being tattooed. Keep in mind that tattoos on the torso, especially on the ribs may require you to be shirtless. If this makes you uncomfortable, consider wearing a button down shirt that can be flipped to reveal the area while covering your front. Eat and hydrate prior to the appointment. Do not drink alcohol the night before your appointment. Bring a water bottle just in case, hydration is important!"

  {
    "question": "+ I have an allergic reaction, what now?",
    "answer": "It is possible to have allergic reactions to certain types of inks. This is more common in red tones and some blues due to the pigments used, but can also happen on a lesser scale with other colours. There is no way for our artists to predict reactions of individual clients to these pigments. There is also a possibility of having a reaction to Hypafix/Tatu-derm bandages due to the adhesive. Though it is a medical grade product there is still the slight chance it could irritate the skin. In the event that this occurs, remove the bandage and do not reapply. Though we appreciate being informed of any reactions or complications any clients may have during their healing process it is very important to contact a licensed medical professional if any symptoms seem concerning."
