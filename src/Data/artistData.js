I have been creating since I remember ( painting, drawing, making graphic designs), and I have translated my curiosity and desire to develop into tattoos. So 4 years ago my adventure with this type of art started for good. My works are illustrative, delicate, focused in detailes. I use extreme fine lines and dotwork for give the character to them. Sometimes I also tattoo tiny, colorful botanical designes, although I mainly work in black colour.",
