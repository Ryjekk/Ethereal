I am a zodiac Virgo, An Earth sign. Even if I look at life through the prism of poetry I try to keep my feet firmly on the ground And this is what I want to convey in my art. Beauty with all kinds of cracks. The truth in all its glory.",
        "paragraph_three": "I have been creating since I can remember ( painting, drawing, graphic designs). I have decided to transform my curiosity and desire to develop into tattooing. And so 4 years ago my adventure with this type of art started for good. My works are illustrative, delicate and focused on details. I use extreme fine lines and dotwork to give unique character to my tattoos. I create my own flashes and customize designs. My great inspirations are nature, emotions and spirituality. I will be glad to get to know your vision for the next tattoo and I will try to meet your expectations as best as I can. :)"

I trust in the wisdom on the Universe, and so I am letting it guide me. As above so below.`,
