Ever changing, as women are - from painting and drawing, through clothing design to handpoke tattoos and more, Marta does not just mark you with ink and bare (well, not literally) needle - she’ll leave a piece of her soul under your skin. I can’t wait to see what another day with her will bring, simply because she’s fuckin’ awesome.”",
