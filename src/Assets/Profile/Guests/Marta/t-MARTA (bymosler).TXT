Since i don’t feel like writing about myself, i’ll let someone else to do it for me. Someone that knows me well enough, cause we spend loads of time together :)

„Late (but not too late) bloomer - that’s who Marta is. A bit crazy young woman with a gift, leaving delicate marks on pretty much everything she touches. Ever changing, as women are - from painting and drawing, through clothing design to handpoke tattoos and more, Marta does not just mark you with ink and bare (well, not literally) needle - she’ll leave a piece of her soul under your skin. I can’t wait to see what another day with her will bring, simply because she’s fuckin’ awesome.” Lucas
