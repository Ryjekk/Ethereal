My name is Róża. I’m a tattooing art historian. That’s why the recurring themes of my work are pieces of art, engravings and book illustrations.I tattoo what I personally love - medieval marginalia and old alchemical symbols English illustrations and modern paintings.
 The original works are transferred directly to the skin as patterns; I also transform the originals and execute my own designs.The series of new linear designs reveal a fascination with the visual culture of Japan, especially the woodblock prints, Noh theatre and Japanese gore. I’m currently developing these two paths – art historical fascinations and psychedelic Japanese style.
