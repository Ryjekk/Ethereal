After more than one decade tattooing I can say I'm still learning day by day, as I used to do when I started. I continue to look for my personal identity as a tattoo artist, however my inclination is to the black&white realism. My philosophy towards the composition, the technique process and the approach to the client is something more than shallow, I try to achieve a connection between my client, the design and myself, on each and every piece.
